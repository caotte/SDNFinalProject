#The main file will iterate through all devices from a database, and
#perform automated actions through requests to each device

#import all modules here:
import sys
import json
import DevRequest



#CO import the json file to generate a dictionary of network devices
#File name is passed as argument to the script at launch
with open(sys.argv[0]) as devFile:
    devices = json.load(devFile)



#CO main loop, iterate through each device in the dictionary,
#and perform automated actions based on the device type
for device in devices:
    if devices[device]["APIType"] == 'NXOS':
        
        #TODO:
        #Increment addressing
        #Add VLAN 120 and SVI's
        #Add HSRP to all interfaces
        #Add OSPF - prefer using RESTCONF
        


    if devices[device]["APIType"] == 'IOSXE':

        #TODO:
        #Increment addressing
        #Add OSPF - prefer using RESTCONF


    else:
        raise AttributeError("Invalid API type.")
